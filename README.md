# Deep Learning IndabaX Rwanda CNN tutorial

* In this tutorial 
we will show how to design and train a ConvNet using PyTorch
* We will also illustrate how the ConvNet makes use of specific assumptions
* the ConvNet overview slides can be found on the tutorial [Github repository](https://github.com/mustafaghali/IndabaX-Rwanda-CNN-tutorial/blob/master/ConvNets%20presentation.pptx)

### When we use the CNNs we make use of the following assumptions about the input images signals 

* Many layers: compositionality
* Convolutions: locality + stationarity of images
* Pooling: Invariance of object class to translations
